# budget-tracker app

# Description:

This is a progressive web application that allows users to track their budgets by adding expenses and deposits to their budget through the "add and/or subtract funds" buttons. The users of this application will be able to add a transaction without an internet connection. When the users enter a transaction while offline, the transactions will be stored in their IndexedDB connection. Once the users' internet connection is restored, the transactions the users have added or subtracted will be transferred out of their IndexedDB and into their MongoDB connection.
